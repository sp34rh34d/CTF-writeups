## Procedure
1



Are you able to unravel the attack chain? The first question is:
What is the name of the service that the attacker ran and stopped, which dumped hashes on the first compromised host?






What lateral movement technique did the threat actor use to move to the other machine?



What is the full path of the binary that the threat actor used to access the privileges of a different user with explicit credentials?


How many accounts were compromised by the threat actor?


What is the full path of the binary that was used to attempt a callback to the threat actor's machine?
