Anyway, have you heard this intro soundtrack from Half-Life 3?

## Procedure
The chall is very simple, we have file with ```.mp3``` extension, but we have to be sure before continue, after run the command ```file Half-Life_3_OST.mp3``` we got the following output ```Half-Life_3_OST.mp3: PNG image data, 800 x 200, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced```.

So we just have to rename the file from ```.mp3``` to ```.png``` and recover the flag.
